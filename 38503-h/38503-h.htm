<p>The plan of this book excludes epic and the drama,
and in general so much of Roman poetry as could
be included only by a licence of excerpt mostly
dangerous and in poetry of any architectonic pretensions
intolerable. If any one remarks as inconsistent with this
plan the inclusion of the more considerable fragments of
Ennius and the early tragedians, I will only say that I have
not thought it worth while to be wiser here than Time and
Fate, which have of their own act given us these poets in
lamentable excerpt. A more real inconsistency may be
found in my treatment of the didactic poets. It seemed
a pity that Didactic Poetry&mdash;in some ways the most
characteristic product of the Roman genius&mdash;should, in
such a Collection as this, be wholly unrepresented. It
seemed a pity: and it seemed also on the whole unnecessary.
It seemed unnecessary, for the reason that
many of the great passages of Lucretius, Vergil, and
Manilius hang so loosely to their contexts that the poets
themselves seem to invite the gentle violence of the excerptor.
These passages are 'golden branches' set in an
alien stock&mdash;<i>non sua seminat arbos</i>. The hand that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
pluck them must be at once courageous and circumspect.
But they attend the fated despoiler:</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ergo alte uestiga oculis et rite repertum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">carpe manu, namque ipse uolens facilisque sequetur<br /></span>
<span class="i0">si te fata uocant.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Even outside Didactic Poetry I have allowed myself an
occasional disloyalty to my own rule against excerpts. I
have, for example, detached one or two lyrics from the
Tragedies of Seneca. And, again, from the long and
sometimes tedious <i>Itinerarium</i> of Rutilius I have detached
the splendid apostrophe to Rome which stands in the
forefront of that poem. These are pieces without which
no anthology of Latin poetry would be anything but
grotesquely incomplete. And after all we should be the
masters and not the slaves of our own rules.</p>

<p>Satire finds no place in this book. Horace is represented
only by his lyrics. Juvenal and Persius are not
represented at all. The <i>Satires</i> and <i>Epistles</i> of Horace are
books of deep and wide influence. They have taught
lessons in school which have been remembered in the world.
They have made an appeal to natures which teaching more
profound and spiritual leaves untouched. By their large
temper and by their complete freedom from cant they have
achieved a place in the regard of men from which they are
not likely to be dislodged by any changes of literary
fashion or any fury of the enemies of humane studies.
I am content to leave them in this secure position, and not
to intrude them into a Collection where Horace himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
would have known them to be out of place. Indeed, he
has himself said upon this subject all that needs to be said.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Persius similarly, in the Prologue to his <i>Satires</i>, excludes
himself from the company of the great poets. Nor can
I believe that Juvenal has any place among them. In the
rhetoric of rancour he is a distinguished practitioner. But
he wants two qualities essential to great poetry&mdash;truth and
humanity. I say this because there are critics who speak
of Juvenal as though he were Isaiah.</p>

<p>My Selection begins with fragments of the Saliar hymns,
and ends with the invocation of Phocas to 'Clio, reverend
wardress of Antiquity.' If I am challenged to justify these
<i>termini</i>, I will say of the first of them that I could not
begin earlier, and that it is commonly better to take the
beginnings offered to us than to make beginnings for ourselves.
The lower <i>terminus</i> is not so simple a matter.
I set myself here two rules. First, I resolved to include
no verse which, tried by what we call 'classical' standards,
was metrically faulty. Secondly, I judged it wiser to
exclude any poetry definitely Christian in character&mdash;a rule
which, as will be seen, does not necessarily exclude all the
work of Christian poets. Within these limits, I was
content to go on so long as I could find verse instinct with
any genuine poetic feeling. The author whose exclusion
I most regret is Prudentius. If any one asks me, Where is
Merobaudes? where Sedulius? where Dracontius? I
answer that they are where they have always been&mdash;out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
account. Interesting, no doubt, in other ways, for the
student of poetry they do not count. Prudentius counts.
He has his place. But it is not in this Collection. It is
among other memories, traditions, and aspirations, by the
threshold of a world where Vergil takes solemn and fated
leave of those whom he has guided and inspired:</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Non aspettar mio dir più nè mio cenno.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I have spent a good deal of labour on the revision of
texts: and I hope that of some poems, particularly the less
known poems, this book may be found to offer a purer
recension than is available elsewhere. I owe it to myself,
however, to say that I have sometimes preferred the convenience
of the reader to the dictates of a rigorous
criticism. I have thought it, for example, not humane to
variegate the text of an Anthology with despairing <i>obeli</i>:
and occasionally I have covered up an indubitable lacuna
by artifices which I trust may pass undetected by the
general reader and unreproved by the charitable critic.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Latin poetry begins where almost all poetry begins&mdash;in
the rude ceremonial of a primitive people placating
an unknown and dreaded spiritual world. The
earliest fragments are priestly incantations. In one of
these fragments the Salii placate Leucesius, the god of
lightning. In another the Arval Brethren placate Mars
or Marmar, the god of pestilence and blight (<i>lues rues</i>).
The gods are most dreaded at the seasons most important
to a primitive people, seed-time, for example, and harvest.
The Salii celebrated Mars at seed-time&mdash;in the month
which bears his name, <i>mensis Martius</i>. The name of the
Arval Brethren betrays their relation to the gods who watch
the sown fields. The aim of this primitive priestly poetry
is to get a particular deity into the power of the worshipper.
To do this it is necessary to know his name and to use it.
In the Arval hymn the name of the god is reiterated&mdash;it
is a spell. Even so Jacob wished to know&mdash;and to use&mdash;the
name of the god with whom he wrestled. These
priestly litanies are accompanied by wild dances&mdash;the Salii
are, etymologically, 'the Dancing men'&mdash;and by the
clashing of shields. They are cast in a metre not unsuited
to the dance by which they are accompanied. This is the
famous Saturnian metre, which remained the metre of all
Latin poetry until the coming of the Greeks. Each verse
falls into two halves corresponding to the forward swing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
and the recoil of the dance. Each half-verse exhibits three
rhythmical beats answering to the beat of a three-step
dance. The verse is in the main accentual. But the
accent is hieratic. The hieratic accent is discovered
chiefly in the first half of the verse: where the natural
accent of a disyllabic word is neglected and the stress falls
constantly on the final syllable.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This hieratic accent in
primitive Latin poetry is important, since it was their
familiar use of it which made it easy for the Romans to
adapt the metres of Greece.</p>

<p>The first poets, then, are the priests. But behind the
priests are the people&mdash;moved by the same religious beliefs
and fears, but inclined, as happens everywhere, to make of
their 'holy day' a 'holiday'. And hence a different
species of poetry, known to us chiefly in connexion with
the harvest-home and with marriage ceremonial&mdash;the so-called
Fescennine poetry. This poetry is dictated by much
the same needs as that of the priests. It is a charm
against <i>fascinum</i>, 'the evil eye': and hence the name
Fescennine. The principal constituent element in this
Fescennine poetry was obscene mockery. This obscenity
was magical. But just as it takes two to make a quarrel,
so the obscene mockery of the Fescennine verses required
two principals. And here, in the improvisations of the
harvest-home, we must seek the origins of two important
species of Latin poetry&mdash;drama and satire.</p>

<p>There was magic in the house as well as in the fields.
Disease and Death demanded, in every household, incantations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
We still possess fragments of Saturnian verse
which were employed as charms against disease. Magic
dirges (<i>neniae</i>) were chanted before the house where a dead
man lay. They were chanted by a <i>praefica</i>, a professional
'wise woman', who placated the dead man by reiterated
praise of him. These chants probably mingled traditional
formulae with improvisation appropriate to particular circumstances.
The office of the <i>praefica</i> survived into a late
period. But with the growth of Rationalism it very early
came into disrepute and contempt. Shorter lived but more
in honour was an institution known to us only from casually
preserved references to it in Cato and Varro. This was
the <i>Song in Praise of Famous Men</i> which was sung at
banquets. Originally it was sung by a choir of carefully
selected boys (<i>pueri modesti</i>), and no doubt its purpose was
to propitiate the shades of the dead. At a later period the
boy choristers disappear, and the <i>Song</i> is sung by individual
banqueters. The ceremony becomes less religious in
character, and exists to minister to the vanity of great
families and to foster patriotism. In Cato's time the
tradition of it survived only as a memory from a very
distant past. Its early extinction must be explained by the
wider use among the Romans of written memorials. Of
these literary records nothing has survived to us: even of
epitaphs preserved to us in inscriptions none is earlier than
the age of Cato. So far as our knowledge of Latin
literature extends we pass at a leap from what may be
called the poetry of primitive magic<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to Livius Andronicus'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
translation of the <i>Odyssey</i>. Yet between the work of
Livius and this magical poetry there must lie a considerable
literary development of which we know nothing. Two
circumstances may serve to bring this home to us. The
first is that stage plays are known to have been performed
in Rome as early as the middle of the fourth century.
The second is that there existed in Rome in the time of
Livius a school of poets and actors who were sufficiently
numerous and important to be permitted to form a Guild or
College.</p>

<p>The position of Livius is not always clearly understood.
We can be sure that he was not the first Roman poet.
Nor is it credible that he was the first Greek teacher to
find his way to Rome from Southern Italy. To what does
he owe his pre-eminence? He owes it, in the first place,
to what may be called a mere accident. He was a schoolmaster:
and in his <i>Odyssey</i> he had the good fortune to
produce for the schools precisely the kind of text-book
which they needed: a text-book which was still used in
the time of Horace. Secondly, Livius Andronicus saved
Roman literature from being destroyed by Greek literature.
We commonly regard him as the pioneer of Hellenism.
This view needs correcting. We shall probably be nearer
the truth if we suppose that Livius represents the reaction
against an already dominant Hellenism. The real peril
was that the Romans might become not too little but too
much Hellenized, that they might lose their nationality as
completely as the Macedonians had done, that they might
employ the Greek language rather than their own for both
poetry and history. From this peril Livius&mdash;and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
patriotic nobles whose ideals he represented&mdash;saved Rome.
It is significant that in his translation of the <i>Odyssey</i> he
employs the old Saturnian measure. Naevius, a little later,
retained the same metre for his epic upon the Punic Wars.
In the epitaph which he composed for himself Naevius says
that 'the Camenae', the native Italian muses, might well
mourn his death, 'for at Rome men have forgotten to speak
in Latin phrase'. He is thinking of Ennius, or the school
which Ennius represents. Ennius' answer has been preserved
to us in the lines in which he alludes scornfully to
the <i>Punica</i> of Naevius as written 'in verses such as the
Fauns and Bards chanted of old', the verses, that is, of
the old poetry of magic. Ennius abandons the Saturnian
for the hexameter. Livius and Naevius had used in drama
some of the simpler Greek metres. It is possible that
some of these had been long since naturalized in Rome&mdash;perhaps
under Etrurian influence. But the abandonment
of the Saturnian was the abandonment of a tradition five
centuries old. The aims of Ennius were not essentially
different from those of Livius and Naevius. But the
peril of a Roman literature in the Greek language was
past; and Ennius could afford to go further in his concessions
to Hellenism. It had been made clear that both
the Latin language and the Latin temper could hold their
own. And when this was made clear the anti-Hellenic
reaction collapsed. Cato was almost exactly contemporary
with Ennius: and he had been the foremost representative
of the reaction. But in his old age he cried 'Peccavi', and
set himself to learn Greek.</p>

<p>Ennius said that he had three hearts, for he spoke three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
tongues&mdash;the Greek, the Oscan, and the Latin. And
Roman poetry has, as it were, three hearts. All through
the Republican era we may distinguish in it three elements.
There is the Greek, or aesthetic, element: all that gives
to it form or technique. There is the primitive Italian
element to which it owes what it has of fire, sensibility,
romance. And finally there is Rome itself, sombre,
puissant, and both in language and ideals conquering by
mass. The effort of Roman poetry is to adjust these three
elements. And this effort yields, under the Republic,
three periods of development. The first covers the second
century and the latter half of the third. In this the
Hellenism is that of the classical era of Greece. The Italian
force is that of Southern and Central Italy. The Roman
force is the inspiration of the Punic Wars. The typical
name in it is that of Ennius. The Roman and Italian elements
are not yet sufficiently subdued to the Hellenic. And
the result is a poetry of some moral power, not wanting in
fire and life, but in the main clumsy and disordered. The
second period covers the first half of the first century.
The Hellenism is Alexandrian. The Italian influence is
from the North of Italy&mdash;the period might, indeed, be
called the Transpadane period of Roman poetry. The
Roman influence is that of the Rome of the Civil Wars.
The typical name in it is that of Catullus&mdash;for Lucretius
is, as it were, a last outpost of the period before: he stands
with Ennius, and the Alexandrine movement has touched
him hardly at all. In this period the Italian (perhaps
largely Celtic) genius is allied with Alexandrianism in
revolt against Rome: and in it Latin poetry may be said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>
attain formal perfection. The third period is the Augustan.
In it we have the final conciliation of the Greek, the Italian,
and the Roman influences. The typical name in it is that
of Vergil, who was born outside the Roman <i>ciuitas</i>, who
looks back to Ennius through Catullus, to Homer through
Apollonius.</p>

<p>It is significant here that it is with the final unification
of Italy (which was accomplished by the enfranchisement of
Transpadane Gaul) that Roman poetry reaches its culmination&mdash;and
at the same time begins to decline. Of the
makers of Roman poetry very few indeed are Roman.
Livius and Ennius were 'semi-Graeci' from Calabria,
Naevius and Lucilius were natives of Campania. Accius and
Plautus&mdash;and, later, Propertius&mdash;were Umbrian. Caecilius
was an Insubrian Gaul. Catullus, Bibaculus, Ticidas, Cinna,
Vergil were Transpadanes. Asinius Gallus came from
Gallia Narbonensis, Horace from Apulia. So long as
there was in the Italian <i>municipia</i> new blood upon which it
could draw, Roman poetry grew in strength. But as soon
as the fresh Italian blood failed Roman poetry failed&mdash;or
at any rate it fell away from its own greatness, it ceased to
be a living and quickening force. It became for the first
time what it was not before&mdash;imitative; that is to say it
now for the first time reproduced without transmuting.
Vergil, of course, 'imitates' Homer. But observe the
nature of this 'imitation'. If I may parody a famous
saying, there is nothing in Vergil which was not previously
in Homer&mdash;<i>save Vergil himself</i>. But the post-Vergilian
poetry is, taken in the mass, without individuality. There is,
of course, after Vergil much in Roman poetry that is interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>
or striking, much that is brilliant, graceful, or noble.
But even so it is notable that much of the best work seems
due to the infusion of a foreign strain. Of the considerable
poets of the Empire, Lucan, Seneca, Martial are of Spanish
birth: and a Spanish origin has been&mdash;perhaps hastily&mdash;conjectured
for Silius. Claudian is an Alexandrian,
Ausonius a Gaul.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Rome's rôle in the world is the
absorption of outlying genius. In poetry as in everything
else <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">urbem fecit quod prius orbis erat</i>.</p>

<p>If we are to understand the character, then, of Roman
poetry in its best period, in the period, that is, which ends
with the death of Augustus, we must figure to ourselves
a great and prosaic people, with a great and prosaic language,
directing and controlling to their own ends spiritual forces
deeper and more subtle than themselves. Of these forces
one is the Greek, the other may for convenience be called
the Italian. In the Italian we must allow for a considerable
intermixture of races: and we must remember that
large tracts at least of Northern Italy, notably Transpadane
Gaul and Umbria, have been penetrated by Celtic influence.
No one can study Roman poetry at all deeply or sympathetically
without feeling how un-Roman much of it really
is: and again&mdash;despite its Hellenic forms and its constant
study of Hellenism&mdash;how un-Greek. It is not Greek and
not Roman, and we may call it Italian for want of a better
name. The effects of this Italian quality in Roman poetry
are both profound and elusive; and it is not easy to
specify them in words. But it is important to seize them:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>
for unless we do so we shall miss that aspect of Roman
poetry which gives it its most real title to be called poetry at
all. Apart from it it is in danger of passing at its best for
rhetoric, at its worst for prose.</p>

<p>Ennius is a poet in whom the Roman, as distinct from
the Italian, temperament has asserted itself strongly. It
has asserted itself most powerfully, of course, in the
<i>Annals</i>. Even in the <i>Annals</i>, however, there is a great
deal that is neither Greek nor Roman. There is an
Italian vividness. The coloured phraseology is Italian.
And a good deal more. But it is in the tragedies&mdash;closely
as they follow Greek models&mdash;that the Italian
element is most pronounced. Take this from the
<i>Alexander</i>:</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">adest, adest fax obuoluta sanguine atque incendio:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">multos annos latuit, ciues, ferte opem et restinguite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">iamque mari magno classis cita<br /></span>
<span class="i0">texitur, exitium examen rapit:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">adueniet, fera ueliuolantibus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">navibus complebit manus litora.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Sellar has called attention to the 'prophetic fury' of
these lines, their 'wild agitated tones'. They seem,
indeed, wrought in fire. Nor do they stand alone in
Ennius. Nor is their fire and swiftness Roman. They
are preserved to us in a passage of Cicero's treatise <i>De
Diuinatione</i>: and in the same passage Cicero applies to
another fragment of Ennius notable epithets. He speaks
of it as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">poema tenerum et moratum et molle</i>. The element of
<i>moratum</i>, the deep moral earnestness, is Roman. The
other two epithets carry us outside the typically Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>
temperament. Everybody remembers Horace's characterization
of Vergil:</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">molle atque facetum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vergilio annuerunt gaudentes rure Camenae.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Horace is speaking there of the Vergil of the Transpadane
period: the reference is to the <i>Eclogues</i>. The
Romans had <i>hard</i> minds. And in the <i>Eclogues</i> they
marvelled primarily at the revelation of temperament which
Horace denotes by the word <i>molle</i>. Propertius, in
whose Umbrian blood there was, it has been conjectured,
probably some admixture of the Celtic, speaks of himself as
<i>mollis in omnes</i>. The <i>ingenium molle</i>, whether in passion, as
with Propertius, or, as with Vergil, in reflection, is that deep
and tender sensibility which is the least Roman thing in the
world, and which, in its subtlest manifestations, is perhaps
the peculiar possession of the Celt. The subtle and
moving effects, in the <i>Eclogues</i>, of this <i>molle ingenium</i>, are
well characterized by Mr. Mackail, when he speaks of
the 'note of brooding pity' which pierces the 'immature
and tremulous cadences' of Vergil's earliest period. This
<i>molle ingenium</i>, that here quivers beneath the half-divined
'pain-of-the-world', is the same temperament as that which
in Catullus gives to the pain of the individual immortally
poignant expression. It is the same temperament, again,
which created Dido. Macrobius tells us that Vergil's Dido
is just the Medea of Apollonius over again. And some
debt Vergil no doubt has to Apollonius. To the Attic
drama his debt is far deeper; and he no doubt intended to
invest the story of Dido with the same kind of interest as
that which attaches to, say, the Phaedra of Euripides.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>
Yet observe. Vergil has not <i>hardness</i> enough. He has
not the unbending righteousness of the tragic manner.
The rather hard moral grandeur of the great Attic
dramatists, their fine spiritual steel, has submitted to a
strange softening process. Something melting and subduing,
something neither Greek nor Roman, has come
in. We are passed out of classicism: we are moving
into what we call romanticism. Aeneas was a brute.
There is nobody who does not feel that. Yet nobody
was meant to feel that. We were meant to feel that
Aeneas was what Vergil so often calls him, <i>pius</i>. But
the Celtic spirit&mdash;for that is what it is&mdash;is over-mastering.
It is its characteristic that it constantly girds
a man&mdash;or a poet&mdash;and carries him whither he would not.
The fourth <i>Aeneid</i> is the triumph of an unconscionable
Celticism over the whole moral plan of Vergil's epic.</p>

<p>I will not mention Lesbia by the side of Dido. The
Celtic spirit too often descends into hell. But I will take
from Catullus in a different mood two other examples of
the Italic romanticism. Consider these three lines:</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">usque dum tremulum mouens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">cana tempus anilitas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">omnia omnibus annuit,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;'till that day when gray old age shaking its palsied head
nods in all things to all assent.' That is not Greek nor
Roman. It is the unelaborate magic of the Celtic temperament.
Keats, I have often thought, would have 'owed
his eyes' to be able to write those three lines. He hits
sometimes a like matchless felicity:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She dwells with Beauty, Beauty that must die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bidding adieu.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But into the effects which Catullus just happens upon by
a luck of temperament Keats puts more of his life-blood
than a man can well spare.</p>

<p>Take, again, this from the <i>Letter to Hortalus</i>. Think
not, says Catullus, that your words have passed from my
heart,</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">ut missum sponsi furtiuo munere malum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">procurrit casto uirginis e gremio,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">quod miserae oblitae molli sub ueste locatum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">dum aduentu matris prosilit, excutitur;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">atque illud prono praeceps agitur decursu,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">huic manat tristi conscius ore rubor,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;'as an apple, sent by some lover, a secret gift, falls from
a maid's chaste bosom. She placed it, poor lass, in the
soft folds of her robe and forgot it. And when her mother
came towards her out it fell; fell and rolled in headlong
course. And vexed and red and wet with tears are her
guilty cheeks!'</p>

<p>That owes something, no doubt, to Alexandria. But
in its exquisite sensibility, its supreme delicacy and tenderness,
it belongs rather to the romantic than to the classical
literatures.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Molle atque facetum</i>: the deep and keen fire of mind,
the quick glow of sensibility&mdash;that is what redeems literature
and life alike from dullness. The Roman, the typical
Roman, was what we call a 'dull man'. But the Italian
has this fire. And it is this that so often redeems Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span>
literature from itself. We are accustomed to associate the
word <i>facetus</i> with the idea of 'wit'. It is to be connected,
it would seem, etymologically with <i>fax</i>, 'a torch'. Its
primitive meaning is 'brightness', 'brilliance': and if we
wish to understand what Horace means when he speaks of
the element of '<i>facetum</i>' in Vergil, perhaps 'glow' or 'fire'
will serve us better than 'wit'. <i>Facetus</i>, <i>facetiae</i>, <i>infacetus</i>,
<i>infacetiae</i> are favourite words with Catullus. With <i>lepidus</i>,
<i>illepidus</i>, <i>uenustus</i>, <i>inuenustus</i> they are his usual terms of
literary praise and dispraise. These words hit, of course,
often very superficial effects. Yet with Catullus and his
friends they stand for a literary ideal deeper than the contexts
in which they occur: and an ideal which, while it no
doubt derives from the enthusiasm of Alexandrian study,
yet assumes a distinctively Italian character. Poetry must be
<i>facetus</i>: it must glow and dance. It must have <i>lepor</i>: it
must be clean and bright. There must be nothing slipshod,
no tarnish. 'Bright is the ring of words when the right
man rings them.' It must have <i>uenustas</i>, 'charm', a certain
melting quality. This ideal Roman poetry never realizes
perhaps in its fullness save in Catullus himself. In the
lighter poets it passes too easily into an ideal of mere
cleverness: until with Ovid (and in a less degree Martial)
<i>lepor</i> is the whole man. In the deeper poets it is oppressed
by more Roman ideals.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facetum ingenium</i>, as it manifests itself in satire and
invective, does not properly here concern us: it belongs to
another order of poetry. Yet I may be allowed to illustrate
from this species of composition the manner in which the
Italian spirit in Roman poetry asserts for itself a dominating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span>
and individual place. <i>Satura quidem tota nostra est</i>, says
Quintilian. We know now that this is not so: that Quintilian
was wrong, or perhaps rather that he has expressed
himself in a misleading fashion. Roman Satire, like the
rest of Roman literature, looks back to the Greek world.
It stands in close relation to Alexandrian Satire&mdash;a literature
of which we have hitherto been hardly aware. Horace,
when he asserted the dependence of Lucilius on the old
Attic Comedy, was nearer the truth than Quintilian. But
the influence of Attic Comedy comes to Lucilius (and to
Horace and to Juvenal and to Persius) by way of the Alexandrian
satirists. From the Alexandrians come many of
the stock themes of Roman Satire, many of its stock characters,
much of its moral sentiment. The <i>captator</i>, the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#956;&#949;&#956;&#968;&#8055;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#962;,</span> the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auarus</i> are not the creation of Horace
and Juvenal. The seventh satire of Juvenal is not the first
'Plaint of the Impoverished Schoolmaster' in literature.
Nor is Horace <i>Sat.</i> II. viii the earliest 'Dinner with a
Nouveau-Riche'. In all this, and in much else in Roman
Satire, we must recognize Alexandrian influence. Yet even
so we can distinguish clearly&mdash;much more clearly, indeed,
than in other departments of Latin poetry&mdash;the Roman and
the primitive Italian elements. 'Ecquid is homo habet
aceti in pectore?' asks Pseudolus in Plautus. And Horace,
in a well-known phrase, speaks of <i>Italum acetum</i>, which the
scholiast renders by 'Romana mordacitas'. This 'vinegar'
is the coarse and biting wit of the Italian countryside. It
has its origin in the casual ribaldry of the <i>uindemiatores</i>: in
the rudely improvized dramatic contests of the harvest-home.
Transported to the city it becomes a permanent part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</a></span>
Roman Satire. Roman Satire has always one hero&mdash;the
average <i>paterfamilias</i>. Often he is wise and mild and
friendly. But as often as not he is merely the <i>uindemiator</i>,
thinly disguised, pert and ready and unscrupulous, 'slinging
vinegar' not only at what is morally wrong but at anything
which he happens either to dislike or not to understand.
The vices of his&mdash;often imaginary&mdash;antagonist are recounted
with evident relish and with parade of detail.</p>

<p>It is not only in Satire that we meet this <i>Italum acetum</i>.
We meet it also in the poetry of personal invective. This
department of Roman poetry would hardly perhaps reward
study&mdash;and it might very well revolt the student&mdash;if it were
not that Catullus has here achieved some of his most memorable
effects. In no writer is the <i>Italum acetum</i> found in so
undiluted a sort. And he stands in this perhaps not so
much for himself as for a Transpadane school. The lampoons
of his compatriot Furius Bibaculus were as famous as
his own. Vergil himself&mdash;if, as seems likely, the <i>Catalepton</i>
be a genuine work of Vergil&mdash;did not escape the Transpadane
fashion. In fact the Italian aptitude for invective seems in
North Italy, allied with the study of Archilochus, to have
created a new type in Latin literature&mdash;a type which Horace
essays not very successfully in the <i>Epodes</i> and some of the
<i>Odes</i>. The invective of Catullus has no humbug of moral
purpose. It has its motive in mere hate. Yet Catullus
knew better than any one how subtle and complex an emotion
is hate. Two poems will illustrate better than anything
I could say his power here: and will at the same time make
clear what I mean when I distinguish the Italian from the
Roman temperament in Latin poetry.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</a></span></p>

<p>Let any one take up the eleventh poem of Catullus:</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">cum suis uiuat ualeatque moechis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">quos simul complexa tenet trecentos,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">nullam amans uere sed identidem omnium<br /></span>
<span class="i0">ilia rumpens.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is invective. There is the lash with a vengeance.
Yet the very stanza that follows ends in a sob:</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">nec meum respectet, ut ante, amorem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">qui illius culpa cecidit uelut prati<br /></span>
<span class="i0">ultimi flos, praetereunte postquam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">tactus aratrost.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Turn now for an inverse effect to the fifty-eighth poem:</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Caeli, Lesbia nostra, Lesbia illa,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">illa Lesbia, quam Catullus unam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">plus quam se atque suos amauit omnes ...<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Note the dragging cadences, the pathetic iteration, the
scarce-concealed agony of longing. Yet this five-line poem
ends in a couplet of intolerable obscenity.</p>

<p>There once more you have the unpredictable Celtic temperament&mdash;obscenity
of wrath dissolving in the tenderness
of unbidden tears, fond regret stung suddenly to a rage foul
and unscrupulous.</p>

<p>But let me here guard against a misapprehension. The
more closely we study Roman poetry the more clearly do
we become aware of the presence in it of a non-Roman
element: and the more does it seem as though this non-Roman
element were the originative force, as though it were
to this that Roman poetry owes most of that in it which
we regard as essentially poetical. The quickening force in
the best Roman poetry is the Italian blood. Yet we speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">xxv</a></span>
of this poetry as Roman: and it is not without reason that
we do so. If it was to a great extent made by Italians, it
was made by Italians who were already Romanized. Indeed
the Italian and the Roman elements are never so separate
or so disparate in actuality as they appear in literary analysis.
The Italian spirit worked always under the spell of Rome,
and not under any merely external compulsion. And the
spell of Rome is over the whole of Roman poetry. The
Italians were only a nation <i>through Rome</i>: and a great poetry
must have behind it a great life: it must express a great
people, their deeds and their ideals. Roman poetry does,
beyond almost any other poetry, bear the impress of a
great nation. And after all the <i>language</i> of this poetry is
the language of the Romans. It is said of it, of course,
that it is an unpoetical language. And it is true that it has
not the dance and brightness of Greek: that it is wanting
in fineness and subtlety: that it is defective in vocabulary.
All this is true. Yet the final test of the poetical character
of a language is the poetry that is written in it. The mere
sound of Roman poetry is the sound of a great nation.
And here let us remember what we ought never to
forget in reading Roman poetry. It was not made to be
read. It was made to be spoken. The Roman for the
most part did not read. He was read to. The difference
is plain enough. Indeed it is common to hear the remark
about this or that book, that 'It is the kind of book that
ought to be read aloud'. Latin books <i>were</i> read aloud.
And this practice must have reacted, however obscurely,
upon the writing of them. Some tinge of rhetoric was
inevitable. And here I am led to a new theme.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Perhaps no poetry of equal power and range is so deeply
infected with rhetoric as the Roman. A principal cause of
this is, no doubt, the language. But there are other causes,
and we shall most easily penetrate these if we consider what
I may call the environment of Roman poetry.</p>

<p>Two conditions in Rome helped to foster literary creation
among a people by temperament unimaginative. Of
these the first is an educational system deliberately and
steadily directed towards the development of poetical talent.
No nation ever believed in poetry so deeply as the Romans.
They were not a people of whom we can say, as we can of
the Greeks, that they were <i>born to</i> art and literature. Those
of them who attained to eminence in art and literature knew
this perfectly well. They knew by how laborious a process
they had themselves arrived at such talent as they
achieved. The characteristic Roman triumphs are the
triumphs of material civilization. But the Romans were
well aware that a material civilization cannot be either organized
or sustained without the aid of spiritual forces, and
that among the most important of the spiritual forces that
hold together the fabric of nationality are art and literature.
With that large common sense of theirs which, as they grew
in historical experience, became more and more spiritual,
they perceived early, and they gauged profoundly, the
importance of accomplishments not native to their genius.
They knew what had happened to the 'valiant kings' who
'lived before Agamemnon'&mdash;and why. The same could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</a></span>
easily happen to a great empire. That is partially, of course,
a utilitarian consideration. But the Romans believed also,
and deeply, in the power of literature&mdash;and particularly of
poetry&mdash;to humanize, to moralize, to mould character, to
inspire action. It was this faith which, as Cicero tells us,
lay behind the great literary movement associated with the
circle of Scipio Africanus. It was this faith which informed
the Augustan literature. Horace was a man of
the world&mdash;or he liked to think himself one. He was no
dreamer. Yet when he speaks of the influence of high
poetry upon the formation of character he speaks with a
grave Puritanism worthy of Plato. These practical Romans
had a practicality deeper than ours. The average Englishman,
when he is told that 'the battle of Waterloo was won
by the sonnets of Wordsworth', is puzzled and even offended.
Nothing of Eton and its playing-fields? Nothing of
Wellington and his Guards? What have sonnets in common
with soldiering? But the Roman knew of himself
that sonnets are a kind of soldiering. And much as he
admired deeds, he knew that there is no deed greater than
'the song that nerves a nation's heart.'</p>

<p>These are not mere words: and this was not, in the
Roman, an idle faith. It was a practical faith; that is to
say, he acted upon it. Upon this faith was based, at any
rate in the early period of Roman history, the whole of the
Roman system of education. The principal business of
the Roman schoolmaster was to take the great poets and
interpret them 'by reading and comment'. Education was
practically synonymous with the study of the poets. The
poets made a man brave, the poets made a man eloquent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</a></span>
the poets made him&mdash;if anything could make him&mdash;poetical.
It is hardly possible to over-estimate the obscure benefit to the
national life of a discipline in which the thought and language
of the best poetry were the earliest formative influences.</p>

<p>The second of the two conditions which favoured literary
creation in Rome was a social system which afforded
to a great and influential class the leisure for literary studies
and the power to forward them. These two conditions
are, roughly, synchronous in their development. Both take
rise in the period of the Punic Wars. The Punic Wars
not only quickened but they deepened and purified Roman
patriotism. They put the history of the world in a new
light to the educated Roman. The antagonism of Greek
and Roman dropped away. The wars with Pyrrhus were
forgotten. The issue was now no longer as between Greece
and Rome, but as between East and West. The Roman
saw in himself the last guardian of the ideals of Western
civilization. He must hand on the torch of Hellenic culture.
Hence, while in other countries Literature <i>happens</i>,
as the sun and the air happen&mdash;as a part of the working of
obscure natural forces&mdash;in Rome it is from the beginning
a premeditated self-conscious organization. This organization
has two instruments&mdash;the school of the <i>grammaticus</i>
and the house of the great noble. Here stands Philocomus,
here Scipio.</p>

<p>In the period of the Punic Wars this organization is only
rudimentary. By no means casual, it is none the less as
yet uninfected by officialism. The transition from the age of
Scipio to the age of Augustus introduced two almost insensible
modifications:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">xxix</a></span></p>

<p>(1) In the earlier period the functions of the <i>grammaticus</i>
and the <i>rhetor</i> were undifferentiated. The <i>grammaticus</i>, as
he was known later, was called then <i>litteratus</i> or <i>litterator</i>.
He taught both poetry and rhetoric. But Suetonius tells
us that the name denoted properly an 'interpres poetarum':
and we may infer that in the early period instruction in
rhetoric was only a very casual adjunct of the functions of
the <i>litterator</i>. At what precise date the office of the <i>litterator</i>
became bifurcated into the two distinct professions
of <i>grammaticus</i> and <i>rhetor</i> we cannot say. It seems likely
that the undivided office was retained in the smaller Italian
towns after it had disappeared from the educational system
of Rome. The author of <i>Catelepton V</i>, who may very well
be Vergil, appears to have frequented a school where poetry
and rhetoric were taught in conjunction. Valerius Cato
and Sulla, the former certainly, the latter probably, a Transpadane,
were known as <i>litteratores</i>. But the <i>litterator</i>
gradually everywhere gave place to the <i>grammaticus</i>: and
behind the <i>grammaticus</i>, like Care behind the horseman,
sits spectrally the <i>rhetor</i>.</p>

<p>(2) The introduction of the <i>rhetor</i> synchronizes with the
transition from the private patron to the patron-as-government-official.
And by an odd accident both changes
worked in one and the same direction. That the system of
literary patronage was in many of its effects injurious to the
Augustan literature is a thesis which was once generally
allowed. But it was a thesis which could easily take exaggerated
expression. And against the view which it presents
there has recently been a not unnatural reaction. A
moderate representative of this reaction is the late Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">xxx</a></span>
Nettleship. 'The intimacy', says Nettleship<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, 'which grew
up between Octavianus and some of the great writers of his
time did not imply more than the relation which ... often
existed between a poor poet and his powerful friend. For
as the men of nobler character among the Roman aristocracy
were mostly ambitious of achieving literary success
themselves, and were sometimes really successful in achieving
it: as they had formed a high ideal of individual culture
... aiming at excellence in literature and philosophy as
well as in politics and the art of war, so they looked with
a kindly eye on the men of talent and genius who with less
wealth and social resources than their own were engaged
in the great work of improving the national literature.'</p>

<p>There is much here which is truly and tellingly said.
We ought never to forget that the system of patronage
sprang from a very lofty notion of patriotism and of the
national welfare. It implies a clear and fine recognition
among the great men of affairs of the principle that a nation's
greatness is not to be measured, and cannot be sustained, by
purely material achievements. It is true, again, that the
system of patronage did not originate with Augustus or the
Augustans. Augustus was a patron of letters just as Scipio
had been&mdash;because he possessed power and taste and a wide
sense of patriotic obligation. So much is true, or fairly
true. But if it is meant, as I think it is, that the literary
patronage of the Princeps was the same in kind as, and
different only in degree from, that exercised by the great
men of the Republican period&mdash;if that is meant, then we
have gone beyond what is either true or plausible.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">xxxi</a></span></p>

<p>I am not concerned here, let me say, with the <i>moral</i>
effects of literary patronage. I am concerned only with
its literary effects. Nor will I charge these to Augustus
alone. He was but one patron&mdash;however powerful&mdash;among
many. He did not create the literature which carries his
name. Nevertheless it seems impossible to doubt that it
was largely moulded under his personal influence, and that
he has left upon it the impress of his own masterful and
imperial temper. Suetonius in a few casual paragraphs gives
us some insight into his literary tastes and methods. He
represents him as from his youth up a genuine enthusiast for
literature: 'Eloquentiam studiaque liberalia (i.e. <i>grammatice</i>
and rhetoric) ab aetate prima et cupide et laboriosissime
exercuit.' Even upon active military service he made a point
of reading, composing, and declaiming daily. He wrote a
variety of prose works, and 'poetica summatim attigit', he
dabbled in poetry. There were still extant in Suetonius'
time two volumes of his poetry, the one a collection of
<i>Epigrammata</i>, the other&mdash;more interesting and significant&mdash;a
hexameter poem upon <i>Sicily</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Moreover Augustus 'nursed
in all ways the literary talent of his time'. He listened
'with charity and long-suffering' to endless recitations 'not
only of poetry and of history but of orations and of
dialogues'. We are somewhat apt, I fancy, to associate
the practice of recitation too exclusively with the literary
circles of the time of Nero, Domitian, and Trajan. Yet
it is quite clear that already in the Augustan age this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">xxxii</a></span>
practice had attained system and elaboration. From the
silence of Cicero in his Letters (the Epistles of Pliny
furnish a notable contrast) we may reasonably infer that the
custom was not known to him. It is no doubt natural in
all ages that poets and orators should inflict their compositions
upon their more intimate friends. No one of us in
a literary society is safe even to-day from this midnight
peril. But even of these informal recitations we hear little
until the Augustan age. Catullus' friend Sestius perhaps
recited his orations in this fashion: but the poem<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> admits
a different interpretation. And it is significant that we
are nowhere told that Cicero declaimed to his friends the
speeches of the second action against Verres. Those
speeches were not delivered in court. They were published
after the flight of Verres. If custom had tolerated it we
may be sure that Cicero would not have been slow to turn
his friends into a jury.</p>

<p>The formal recitation, recitation as a 'function', would
seem to be the creation of the Principate. It was the product
in part, no doubt, of the Hellenizing movement which
dominated all departments of literary fashion. But we may
plausibly place its origin not so much in the vanity of authors
seeking applause, or in that absence of literary vanity which
courts a frank criticism, as in the relations of the wealthy
patron and his poor but ambitious client. The patron, in
fact, did not subscribe for what he had not read&mdash;or heard.
The endless recitations to which Augustus listened were
hardly those merely of his personal friends. He listened, as
Suetonius says, 'benigne et patienter'. But it was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">xxxiii</a></span>
'benignity and patience' not of a personal friend but of a
government official&mdash;of a government official dispensing
patronage. Suetonius allows us to divine something of the
tastes of this all-powerful official. He was the particular
enemy of 'that style which is easier admired than understood'&mdash;<i>quae
mirentur potius homines quam intellegant</i>. It
looks as though the clearness and good sense which mark
so distinctively the best Augustan literature were developed
to some extent under the direct influence of the Princeps.</p>

<p>The Princeps and his coadjutors may perhaps be not
unprofitably regarded as the heads of a great Educational
Department. Beneath them are numberless <i>grammatici</i>
and <i>rhetores</i>. The work of these is directed towards the
ideals of the supreme heads of the Department. How far
this direction is due to accident and how far to some not
very defined control it would be impossible to say. But
obviously among the conscious aims of the schools of many
of these <i>grammatici</i> and <i>rhetores</i> was the ambition of
achieving some of the great prizes of the literary world.
The goal of the pupil was government preferment, as we
should call it. And we may perhaps be allowed, if we
guard ourselves against the peril of mistaking a distant
analogy for a real similarity of conditions, to see in the
recitations before the Emperor and his ministers, an inspection,
as it were, of schools and universities, an examination
for literary honours and emoluments. And this
being so, it is not to no purpose that the <i>rhetor</i> in this age
stands behind the <i>grammaticus</i>. For the final examination,
the inspection-by-recitation, is bound to be, whatever the
wishes of any of the parties concerned, an examination in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">xxxiv</a></span>
rhetoric. The theme appointed may be history, it may be
philosophy, it may be poetry. But the performance will be,
and must be, rhetoric. The <i>Aeneid</i> of Vergil may be read
and re-read by posterity, and pondered word by word, line
upon line. But it is going to be judged at a single recitation.
For Vergil, it is true, there may be special terms.
But this will be the lot of the many; and the many will
develop, to suit it, a fashion of poetry the influence of
which even Vergil himself will hardly altogether escape.
Moreover, there will be, of course, other patrons than the
Princeps, at once less patient and less intelligent.</p>

<p>These effects of recitation we recognize, of course,
easily enough in the case of such a poet as Lucan. But
we must go back further. Vergil is, no doubt, as little
like Lucan as he well could be. Yet he did not sit at the
feet of Epidius for nothing: and he did not forget when
he wrote the fourth book of the <i>Aeneid</i> that he would one
day read it to Augustus. We know that there are several
kinds of oratory. But we are inclined, I think, to suppose
that there is only one kind of rhetoric&mdash;that rhetoric is
always the same thing. Yet there are at least two kinds of
rhetoric. In the practical world there are two conquering
forces&mdash;the iron hand and the velvet glove. Just so in
rhetoric&mdash;which in the spiritual world is one of the greatest,
and very often one of the noblest, of conquering forces&mdash;there
is the iron manner and the velvet manner. Lucan
goes home like a dagger thrust. His is the rhetoric that
cuts and beats. The rhetoric of Vergil is soft and devious.
He makes no attempt to astonish, to perplex, to horrify.
He aims to move us in a wholly different manner. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">xxxv</a></span>
yet, like Lucan, he aims to move us <i>once and for all</i>. He
aims to be understood upon a first hearing. I know that
this sounds like a paradox. I shall be told that Vergil is
of all poets the most indirect. That is perfectly true. But
<i>why</i> is Vergil of all poets the most indirect? Just because
he is always trying at all costs to make himself clear.
Lucan says a thing once and is done with it. Vergil cannot.
He begins all over again. He touches and retouches.
He has no 'theme' not succeeded by a 'variation'.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In
Lucan everything depends upon concentration, in Vergil
upon amplification. Both are trying painfully to be understood
on a first hearing&mdash;or, rather, to make, on a first
hearing, the emotional or ethical effect at which they aim.
Any page of Vergil will illustrate at once what I mean. I
select at random the opening lines of the third <i>Aeneid</i>:</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">postquam res Asiae Priamique euertere gentem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">immeritam uisum superis, ceciditque superbum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ilium, et omnis humo fumat Neptunia Troia;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">diuersa exsilia et desertas quaerere terras<br /></span>
<span class="i0">auguriis agimur diuum, classemque sub ipsa<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Antandro et Phrygiae molimur montibus Idae,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">incerti quo fata ferant, ubi sistere detur.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The first three lines might have been expressed by an
ablative absolute in two words&mdash;<i>Troia euersa</i>. But observe.
To <i>res Asiae</i> in 1 Vergil adds the explanatory <i>Priami
gentem</i>, amplifying in 2 with the new detail <i>immeritam</i>.
<i>Euertere uisum</i> (1-2) is caught up by <i>ceciditque Ilium</i> (2-3),
with the new detail <i>superbum</i> added, and again echoed (3)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">xxxvi</a></span>
by <i>humo fumat</i>&mdash;<i>fumat</i> giving a fresh touch to the picture.
In 4 <i>diuersa exsilia</i> is reinforced by <i>desertas terras</i>, <i>sub ipsa
Antandro</i> (5-6) by <i>montibus Idae</i> (6). In 7 <i>ubi sistere detur</i>
echoes <i>quo fata ferant</i>. One has only to contrast the
rapidity of Homer, in whom every line marks decisive
advance. But Vergil diffuses himself. And this diffusion
is in its origin and aim rhetorical.</p>

<p>Yet he did not write, and I do not mean to suggest that
he wrote, for an <i>auditorium</i> and &#7952;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#967;&#961;&#8134;&#956;&#945;, and not for
the scrupulous consideration of after ages. He wrote to
be read and pondered. But he is haunted nevertheless by
the thought of the <i>auditorium</i>. It distracts, and even divides,
his literary consciousness. He writes, perhaps without
knowing it, for two classes&mdash;for the members of his patron's
salon and for the scholar in his study. We shall not judge
his style truly if we allow ourselves wholly to forget the
<i>auditorium</i>. And here let me add that we shall equally
fail to understand the style of Lucan or that of Statius if
we remember, as we are apt to do, only the <i>auditorium</i>. The
<i>auditorium</i> is a much more dominating force in their consciousness
than it is in that of Vergil. But even they rarely
allow themselves to forget the judgement of the scholar and
of posterity. They did not choose and place their words with
so meticulous a care merely for the audience of an afternoon.
If we sometimes are offended by their evident subservience
to the theatre, yet on the whole we have greater reason to
admire the courage and conscience with which they strove
nevertheless to keep before them the thought of a wider
and more distant and true-judging audience.</p>

<p>I have intentionally selected for notice that rhetorical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">xxxvii</a></span>
feature in Vergil's style which is, I think, the least obvious.
How much of the <i>Aeneid</i> was written ultimately by Epidius
I hardly like to inquire. Nowhere does Vergil completely
succeed in concealing his rhetorical schooling. Even in
his greatest moments he is still to a large extent a rhetorician.
Indeed I am not sure that he ever writes pure
poetry&mdash;poetry which is as purely poetry as that of Catullus.
Take the fourth book of the <i>Aeneid</i>, which has so much
passionate Italian quality. Even there Vergil does not
forget the mere formal rules of rhetoric. Analyse any
speech of Dido. Dido knows all the rules. You can
christen out of Quintilian almost all the figures of rhetoric
which she employs. Here is a theme which I have not
leisure to develop. But it is interesting to remember in
this connexion the immense and direct influence which
Vergil has had upon British oratory. Burke went nowhere
without a copy of Vergil in his pocket. Nor is it for
nothing that the fashion of Vergilian quotation so long
dominated our parliamentary eloquence. These quotations
had a perfect appropriateness in a rhetorical context: for
they are the language of a mind by nature and by education
rhetorical.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Roman poetry continued for no less than five centuries
after the death of Vergil&mdash;and by Roman poetry I mean
a Latin poetry classical in form and sentiment. But of
these five centuries only two count. The second and third
centuries <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> are a Dark Age dividing the silver twilight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">xxxviii</a></span>
of the century succeeding the age of Horace from the brief
but brilliant Renaissance of the fourth century: and in the
fifth century we pass into a new darkness. The infection
of the Augustan tradition is sufficiently powerful in the
first century to give the impulse to poetic work of high and
noble quality. And six considerable names adorn the
period from Nero to Domitian. Of these the greatest are
perhaps those of Seneca, Lucan, and Martial. All three
are of Spanish origin: and it is perhaps to their foreign
blood that they owe the genius which redeems their work
from its very obvious faults. It is the fashion to decry
Seneca and Lucan as mere rhetoricians. Yet in both
there is something greater and deeper than mere rhetoric.
They move by habit grandly among large ideas. Life is
still deep and tremendous and sonorous. Their work has
a certain Titanic quality. We judge their poetry too much
by their biography, and their biography too little in relation
to the terrible character of their times. Martial is a poet
of a very different order. Yet in an inferior <i>genre</i> he is
supreme. No other poet in any language has the same
never-failing grace and charm and brilliance, the same
arresting ingenuity, an equal facility and finish. We speak
of his faults, yet, if the truth must be told, his poetry is
faultless&mdash;save for one fault: its utter want of moral
character. The three other great names of the period are
Statius, Silius, and Valerius. Poets of great talent but no
genius, they 'adore the footsteps' of an unapproachable
master. Religiously careful artists, they see the world
through the eyes of others. Sensible to the effects of
Greatness, they have never touched and handled it. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">xxxix</a></span>
know it only from the poets whom they imitate. The
four winds of life have never beat upon their decorous faces.
We would gladly give the best that they offer us&mdash;and it
is often of fine quality&mdash;for something much inferior in art
but superior in the indefinable qualities of freshness and
gusto. The exhaustion of the period is well seen in
Juvenal&mdash;in the jaded relish of his descriptions of vice, in
the complete unreality of his moral code, in a rhetoric which
for ever just misses the fine effects which it laboriously
calculates.</p>

<p>The second century is barren. Yet we are dimly aware
in the reign of Hadrian of an abortive Revival. We hear
of a school of <i>neoterici</i>: and these <i>neoterici</i> aimed at just
what was needed&mdash;greater freshness and life. They experimented
in metre, and they experimented in language. They
tried to use in poetry the language of common speech, the
language of Italy rather than that of Rome, and to bring
into literature once again colour and motion. The most
eminent of these <i>neoterici</i> is Annius Florus, of whom we
possess some notable fragments. But the movement failed;
and Florus is the only name that arrests the attention of
the student of Roman poetry between Martial and Nemesianus.
Nemesianus is African, and his poems were not
written in Rome. But his graceful genius perhaps owes
something to the impulsion given to literary studies by
Numerian&mdash;one of the few emperors of the period who
exhibit any interest in the progress of literature. The
fourth century is the period of Renaissance. We may see
in Tiberianus the herald of this Renaissance. The four
poems which can be certainly assigned to him are distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">xl</a></span>
by great power and charm. It is a plausible
view that he is also the author of the remarkable <i>Peruigilium
Veneris</i>&mdash;that poem proceeds at any rate from the school
to which Tiberianus belongs. The style of Tiberianus is
formed in the academies of Africa, and so also perhaps his
philosophy. The Platonic hymn to the Nameless God
is a noble monument of the dying Paganism of the era.
Tiberianus' political activities took him to Gaul: and Gaul
is the true home of this fourth-century Renaissance. In
Gaul around Ausonius there grew up at Bordeaux a numerous
and accomplished and enthusiastic school of poets. To
find a parallel to the brilliance and enthusiasm of this school
we must go back to the school of poets which grew up around
Valerius Cato in Transpadane Gaul in the first century B.C.
The Bordeaux school is particularly interesting from its
attitude to Christianity. Among Ausonius' friends was the
austere Paulinus of Nola, and Ausonius himself was a convert
to the Christian faith. But his Christianity is only
skin-deep. His Bible is Vergil, his books of devotion are
Horace and Ovid and Statius. The symbols of the Greek
mythology are nearer and dearer to him than the symbolism
of the Cross. The last enemy which Christianity had to
overcome was, in fact, Literature. And strangely enough
the conquest was to be achieved finally, not by the superior
ethical quality of the new religion, but by the havoc wrought
in Latin speech by the invasion of the Barbarians, by the
decay of language and of linguistic study. To the period
of Ausonius&mdash;and probably to Gaul&mdash;belong the rather
obscure Asmenidae&mdash;the 'sons', or pupils, of Asmenius.
At least two of them, Palladius and Asclepiadius, exhibit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">xli</a></span>
genuine poetical accomplishment. But the schools both of
Ausonius and of Asmenius show at least in one particular
how relaxed had become the hold even upon its enthusiasts
of the true classical tradition. All these poets have a passion
for triviality, for every kind of <i>tour de force</i>, for conceits
and mannerisms. At times they are not so much poets as
the acrobats of poetry.</p>

<p>The end of the century gives us Claudian, and a reaction
against this triviality. 'Paganus peruicacissimus,' as Orosius
calls him, Claudian presents the problem of a poet whose
poetry treats with real power the circumstances of an age
from which the poet himself is as detached as can be.
Claudian's real world is a world which was never to be
again, a world of great princes and exalted virtues, a world
animated by a religion in which Rome herself, strong and
serene, is the principal deity. Accident has thrown him
into the midst of a political nightmare dominated by intriguing
viziers and delivered to a superstition which made men
at once weak and cruel. Yet this world, so unreal to him,
he presents in a rhetorical colouring extraordinarily effective.
Had he possessed a truer instinct for things as they are he
might have been the greatest of the Roman satirists. He
has a real mastery of the art of invective. But, while he
is great where he condemns, where he blesses he is mostly
contemptible. He has too many of the arts of the cringing
Alexandrian. And they availed him nothing. Over every
page may be heard the steady tramp of the feet of the
barbarian invader.</p>

<p>After Claudian we pass into the final darkness. The
gloom is illuminated for a brief moment by the Gaul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">xlii</a></span>
Rutilius. But Rutilius has really outlived Roman poetry
and Rome itself. Nothing that he admires is any longer
real save in his admiration of it. The things that he
condemns most bitterly are the things which were destined
to dominate the world for ten centuries. Christianity is
'a worse poison than witchcraft'. The monastic spirit is
the 'fool-fury of a brain unhinged'. The monasteries are
'slave-dungeons'.</p>

<p>It was these 'slave-dungeons' which were to keep safe
through the long night of the Middle Ages all that Rutilius
held dear. It was these 'slave-dungeons' which were to
afford a last miserable refuge to the works of that long line
of poets of whom Rutilius is the late and forlorn descendant.
Much indeed was to perish even within the fastnesses of
these 'slave-dungeons': for the monasteries were not
always secure from the shock of war, nor the precious
memorials which they housed from the fury of fanaticism.
Yet much was to survive and to emerge one day from the
darkness and to renew the face of the world. Rutilius
wrote his poem in 416 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> If he could have looked
forward exactly a thousand years he would have beheld
Poggio and the great Discoverers of the Italian Renaissance
ransacking the 'slave-dungeons' of Italy, France, and
Germany, and rejoicing over each recovered fragment of
antiquity with a pure joy not unlike that which heavenly
minds are said to feel over the salvation of souls. These
men were, indeed, kindling into life again the soul of Europe.
They were assisting at a New Birth. In this process of
regeneration the deepest force was a Latin force, and of
this Latin force the most impelling part was Latin poetry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">xliii</a></span>
We are apt to-day, perhaps, in our zeal of Hellenism, to
forget, or to disparage, the part which Latin poetry has
sustained in moulding the literatures of modern Europe.
But if the test of great poetry is the length and breadth of
its influence in the world, then Roman poetry has nothing
to fear from the vagaries of modern fashion. For no other
poetry has so deeply and so continuously influenced the
thought and feeling of mankind. Its sway has been wider
than that of Rome itself: and the Genius that broods over
the Capitoline Hill might with some show of justice still
claim, as his gaze sweeps over the immense field of modern
poetry, that he beholds nothing which does not owe allegiance
to Rome:</p>

<h2><a name="TRANSLATIONS_AND_IMITATIONS" id="TRANSLATIONS_AND_IMITATIONS"></a>TRANSLATIONS AND IMITATIONS</h2>


<p>The Selection that follows needs some explanation.
I have made no systematic search in the literature of
translation: and it is likely enough that I have omitted
renderings more beautiful, or more interesting, than some
which I have included. I have not tried to do more than
to collect together a few old 'favourites' of my own.
Moreover I have&mdash;save for one or two examples&mdash;confined
myself to the four principal Latin poets.</p>

<p>I have interpreted the word 'Imitations' rather widely.
It is quite possible, for example, that Clough never read
Vergil's <i>Lines Written in a Lecture-Room</i> (Catalepton V):
yet the poem of Clough which I have brought into connexion
with this piece is, I think, a truer translation of it
than could be found elsewhere. I will venture to hope,

Epitaph upon Mrs. Corbet, with Johnson's comment:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">HERE rests a woman good without pretence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blest with plain reason and with sober sense.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No conquest she, but o'er herself, desired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No arts essayed but not to be admired.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passion and pride were to her soul unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Convinced that Virtue only is our own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So unaffected, so composed a mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So firm, yet soft, so strong, yet so refined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven, as its purest gold, by tortures tried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The saint sustained it, but the woman died.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'The subject of it', says Johnson, 'is a character not
discriminated by any shining or eminent peculiarities: yet
that which really makes, though not the splendour, the
felicity of life, and that which every wise man will choose
for his final and lasting companion in the languor of age,
in the quiet of privacy, when he departs weary and
disgusted from the ostentatious, the volatile and the vain.
Of such a character, which the dull overlook, and the gay
despise, it was fit that the value should be made known
and the dignity established.'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span></p>

<span class="i0">Yet still happier this: to possess, impregnably guarded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those calm heights of the sages, which have for an origin Wisdom:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence to survey our fellows, observe them this way and that way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wander amidst Life's path, poor stragglers seeking a highway:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watch mind battle with mind, and escutcheon rival escutcheon:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaze on that untold strife, which is waged 'neath the sun and the starlight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up as they toil on the surface whereon rest Riches and Empire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O race born unto trouble! O minds all lacking of eye-sight!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Neath what a vital darkness, amidst how terrible dangers<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Parted and passed from the body, the mind too bask in a blissful<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now as regards man's body, a few things only are needful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Few, tho' we sum up all), to remove all misery from him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aye, and to strew in his path such a lib'ral carpet of pleasures<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That scarce Nature herself would at times ask happiness greater.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Statues of youth and of beauty may not gleam golden around him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Each in his right hand bearing a great lamp lustrously burning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence to the midnight revel a light may be furnishëd always),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silver may not shine softly, nor gold blaze bright, in his mansion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor to the noise of the tabret his halls gold-cornicëd echo:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still he, with his fellow, reposed on the velvety greensward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near to a rippling stream, by a tall tree canopied over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall, though they lack great riches, enjoy all bodily pleasure:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chiefliest then when above them a fair sky smiles, and the young year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flings with a bounteous hand over each green meadow the wild-flowers:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not more quickly depart from his bosom fiery fevers,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Therefore, since to the body avail not riches, avails not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heraldry's utmost boast, nor the pomp and pride of an empire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next shall you own that the mind needs likewise nothing of these things;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless&mdash;when, peradventure, your armies over the champaign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread with a stir and a ferment and bid War's image awaken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or when with stir and with ferment a fleet sails forth upon ocean&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cowed before these brave sights, pale Superstition abandon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straightway your mind as you gaze, Death seem no longer alarming,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trouble vacate your bosom and Peace hold holiday in you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if (again) all this be a vain impossible fiction,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If of a truth men's fears and the cares which hourly beset them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heed not the javelin's fury, regard not clashing of broad-swords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all boldly amongst crowned heads and the rulers of empires<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stalk, not shrinking abashed from the dazzling glare of the red gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not from the pomp of the monarch who walks forth purple-apparelled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These things shew that at times we are bankrupt, surely, of reason:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think too that all man's life through a great Dark laboureth onward.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as a young boy trembles and in that mystery, Darkness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sees all terrible things: so do we too, ev'n in the daylight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ofttimes shudder at that which is not more really alarming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than boys' fears when they waken and say some danger is o'er them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So this panic of mind, these clouds which gather around us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fly not the bright sunbeam, nor the ivory shafts of the daylight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature, rightly revealed, and the Reason only, dispel them.<br /></span>

<p>Of this, one of the most famous and effective of Catullus's
poems, I offer two versions. The first (an adaptation) is
by 'knowing Walsh', the friend of Pope, pronounced by
Dryden to be 'the first critic in the nation': the second
is by Prof. Slater of Cardiff:</p>

<p>Dryden's version of this piece shows him at his best as
a translator of Vergil. 'Methinks I come,' he writes,
'like a malefactor, to make a speech upon the gallows,
and to warn all other poets, by my sad example, from the
sacrilege of translating Vergil.' But in the <i>Georgics</i>, at
any rate, which he reckons 'more perfect in their kind than
even the divine Aeneids,' he can challenge comparison
with most of his rivals.</p>

<p>Milton's version has been a good deal criticized. Yet,
though it lacks the lightness of its original, it remains a
nobler version than any other. Of other versions the most
interesting is, perhaps, that of Chatterton (made from a
literal English translation), and the most graceful that of
William Hamilton of Bangour. Of the latter I quote a
few lines:</p>

<p>I print Dryden's version in its entirety. 'I have endeavoured
to make it my masterpiece in English,' he says.

the same time keeps the friendly and familiar strokes of
style which lighten Horace's graver moods.</p>

<h2><a name="NOTE_UPON_THE_SATURNIAN" id="NOTE_UPON_THE_SATURNIAN"></a>NOTE UPON THE SATURNIAN
METRE</h2>


<p>This metre is illustrated by Nos. <b>1-4</b> (?), <b>5-6</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>10</b>,
<b>12-13</b> in this selection. Three views have been taken of
its character.</p>

<p>1. It was at one time supposed to be purely quantitative.
This view had the support of Bentley, who in the <i>Phalaris</i>
(226-8) identified the Saturnian with a metre of Archilochus.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
'There's no difference at all', he says blithely.
In more recent times the quantitative theory, in one form
or another, has numbered among its adherents scholars
of repute: e.g. Ritschl, Lucian Mueller, Christ, Havet.
To-day it may be said to be a dead superstition. Its
place has been taken by what may be called the 'semi-quantitative'
theory.</p>

<p>2. The 'semi-quantitative' theory was popularized in
this country by H. Nettleship<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and J. Wordsworth<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. It
enjoyed the vogue which commonly attends a compromise;
and it still has its adherents, as, for example, E.V. Arnold<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
(who follows the Plautine scholar F. Leo). But the more
it is examined the more it tends, I think, to melt into a
'pure-accentual' theory. 'It allows the shortening of
a long syllable when unaccented (<i>d&#277;victis</i>)', says Nettleship<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.
Surely to say that <i>d&#277;victis</i> is 'allowed' for <i>d&#275;victis</i>
is to abandon the cause outright. But it is considerations
of a more general character which seem likely to render
untenable both the 'quantitative' and the 'semi-quantitative'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
theories. The recent researches of Sievers<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and
others into the earliest metrical forms tend to shew that
this metre is an 'Indo-European' heritage, and that it must
be judged in the light of its Eastern and Germanic
cognates.</p>

<p>3. The best opinion, therefore, in recent years has been
strongly on the side of the view which makes the principle
of the Saturnian metre purely accentual. At the moment
this view may, in fact, be said to hold the field. Unhappily
those who agree in regarding the metre as purely
accentual agree in little else. We may distinguish two
schools:</p>

<p>(a) There is, first, what I may perhaps be allowed to call
the Queen-and-Parlour school. 'There cannot be a more
perfect Saturnian line', says Macaulay, 'than one which
is sung in every English nursery&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The queen was in her parlour eating bread and honey'.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Place beside this English line the Latin line which has
come to be regarded as the typical Saturnian&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">dabunt malum Metelli Naeuio poetae.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If we accent these five words as Naevius and the Metelli
would in ordinary speech have accented them, we shall
have to place our accents thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">dábunt málum Metélli Naéuio poétae;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>since by what is known as the Law of the Penultimate
the accent in Latin always falls on the penultimate syllable
save in those words of three (or more) syllables which have
a short penultimate and take the accent consequently on
the ante-penultimate syllable. But those who accommodate
the Latin saturnian to the rhythm of 'The queen was in
her parlour ...' have to postulate an anomalous
accentuation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">dabúnt malúm Metélli | Naéuió poétae.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Saturnian line is, they hold, a verse falling into two
cola, each colon containing three accented (and an undefined
number of unaccented) syllables&mdash;word-accent and
verse-accent (i. e. metrical <i>ictus</i>) corresponding necessarily
only at the last accented syllable in each colon (as Met<b>é</b>lli
... po<b>é</b>tae above).</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span></p>

<p>Now here there are at least four serious difficulties:</p>

<p>1. While the principle of the verse is accentual half the
words in any given line may be accented as they were never
accented anywhere else.</p>

<p>2. Sometimes verse-accent and word-accent do not
correspond even at the last accent in a colon. There
is, for example, no better authenticated Saturnian than</p>

<p>Cornelius Lucius Scipio Barbatus:</p>

<p>and it is incredible that at any period in the history of
the Latin language the word-accent ever fell on the middle
syllable of <i>Lucius</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.</p>

<p>3. The incidence of word-accent is left unfixed save so
far as the incidence of verse-accent enables us to fix it.
But the incidence of the verse-accent is itself hopelessly
uncertain. In a very large percentage of saturnian lines
we abandon the natural word-accent and have at the same
time no possible means of determining upon what syllable
of what word we are to put the verse-accent.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">dabúnt malúm Metélli Naéuió poétae<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is simple enough: but when we come to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">sin illos deserant fortissimos uiros<br /></span>
<span class="i0">magnum stuprum populo fieri per gentes<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">dedet Tempestatibus aide meretod<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>we come, to speak frankly, to chaos.</p>

<p>4. A large number of well-attested saturnians yield only
two accents in the second <i>colon</i>.</p>

<p>(b) Beside the 'Queen-and-Parlour' theory there is
what I may call the Normal Accent Theory. It originated
with two papers by W.M. Lindsay in the <i>American
Journal of Philology</i> vol. xiv&mdash;papers which furnish a more
thorough and penetrating treatment of the whole subject
than is to be found anywhere else. Lindsay's view is in
substance this:</p>

<p>1. The saturnian line falls into two <i>cola</i> of which the
first (<i>a</i>) contains <i>three</i>, the second (<i>b</i>) <i>two</i> accented
syllables.</p>

<p>2. <i>a</i> contains seven syllables in all, <i>b</i> contains six (occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
five), save when &#7509;&#7509; takes the place of one accented
syllable.</p>

<p>3. The accent is always the normal Latin accent,
according to the Law of the Penultimate.</p>

<p>(A tetrasyllabic word has two accents when it stands
at the beginning of a line, and a pentasyllabic word always.)</p>

<p>4. Each line begins with an accented syllable.</p>

<p>These are the essential rules. In addition Lindsay has
been at pains to determine carefully the accentuation of
'word-groups'. Each word in a Latin sentence has not
necessarily an accent of its own. Thus <i>apud uos</i> is
accented <i>apúd-uos</i>; so again <i>in-grémium</i>, <i>quei-númquam</i>,
<i>ís hic-sítus</i>. No part of Lindsay's papers throws so much
light on the scansion of the saturnian verses as that which
deals with these word-groups: but it is impossible here to
deal with the subject in detail. I will give here the first
two Scipio Epitaphs (5. <i>i</i>, <i>ii</i>) as they are scanned and
accented by Lindsay:&mdash;</p>

<p>But is it certain, after all, that the accent-law in
Saturnian verse <i>is</i> the Law of the Penultimate? There
was, as is well known, a period in the history of the Latin
language when this Law did not obtain, but all Latin
words were alike accented on the first syllable. When
this period ended we cannot precisely determine. But, as
Lindsay himself points out, the influence of the old protosyllabic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>
accentuation was not quite dead even in the time
of Plautus.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Now the saturnian verse undoubtedly reaches
back to a very remote antiquity: even of our extant
specimens some are very likely as old as the eighth century.
It is probable enough, therefore, that the accent-law
known at any rate to the first saturnian poets was the old
protosyllabic law. And when we remember the hieratic
character of the earliest poetry, when we take into account
the conservatism of any priestly ritual or rule, may we not
suppose it possible that saturnian verse retained the
ancient law of accentuation long after the Law of the
Penultimate had asserted itself in ordinary speech and in
other forms of literature? Accented, as Lindsay accents it,
according to the Law of the Penultimate, the saturnian
loses the lilt and swing which it has under the old 'Queen-and-Parlour'
system.</p>

<p>is not a music to pray to or dance to or die to.    A much
easier and more lively movement would be</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">dábunt málum Mételli Naéuio póetae,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>that is, the movement given by the old protosyllabic
accentuation.</p>

<p>The suggestion that the protosyllabic accent survived as
a conscious archaism in saturnian verse right down to the
time of the Scipios is, I think, at any rate worth considering.
It carries us into speculations far wider than the particular
problem with which it is immediately concerned. For if
the protosyllabic law did actually survive in this way we
can the more easily explain the swift and decisive victory
which the Hellenizing Latin poetry won over the old
native verse. What was conquered was an archaism,
something purely artificial. The conquering force was not
merely Hellenism but Hellenism <i>plus</i> a complete and
radical change in Latin speech.</p>

<p>If anyone cares to analyse the extant remains of
saturnian verse in the light of this suggestion, I would
formulate three rules which can, I think, be deduced:</p>

<p>1. Each line has five feet, and each foot contains one
accented syllable <i>plus</i> either one or two unaccented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
syllables.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The first foot, however, <i>may</i> consist of
a monosyllable.</p>

<p>2. The third foot must consist of a trisyllabic word or
'word-group'<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>: save that occasionally the second and
third feet together may be formed of a quadrisyllabic (or
pentasyllabic) word with secondary accent.</p>

<p>3. The first and second, and again the fourth and fifth,
feet may be either disyllabic or trisyllabic: but (<i>a</i>) two
trisyllables may not follow one another in the first two feet,
and (<i>b</i>) if the fifth foot (usually trisyllabic) is a disyllable
the fourth must be trisyllabic.</p>

<p>The normal type is</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="meter">
<tr><td align="left">&#9472;&#769;&#9472; &#9472;&#9472; &#9474; &#9472;&#769;&#9472; &#9472;&#9472; &#9474; &#9472;&#769;&#9472; &#9472;&#9472; &#9472;&#9472;</td><td align="left">&#9474;&#9474; &#9472;&#769;&#9472; &#9472;&#9472;</td><td align="left">&#9474; &#9472;&#769;&#9472; &#9472;&#9472; &#9472;&#9472;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"></td><td align="left">&#9474;&#9474; &#9472;&#769;&#9472; &#9472;&#9472; &#9472;&#9472;</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>A common variation in the first two feet is either
&#9472;&#769;&#9472;&nbsp;&#9472;&#9472;&nbsp;&#9472;&#9472;&nbsp;&#9474;&nbsp;&#9472;&#769;&#9472;&nbsp;&#9472;&#9472;, or
&#9472;&#769;&#9472;&nbsp;&#9472;&#9472;&nbsp;&#9474;&nbsp;&#9472;&#769;&#9472;&nbsp;&#9472;&#9472;&nbsp;&#9472;&#9472;. A somewhat rare variation in
the last two is &#9472;&#769;&#9472;&nbsp;&#9472;&#9472;&nbsp;&#9472;&#9472;&nbsp;&#9474;&nbsp;&#9472;&#769;&#9472;&nbsp;&#9472;&#9472;. In the first foot &#9472;&#769;&#9472; sometimes
replaces &#9472;&#769;&#9472;&nbsp;&#9472;&#9472; (or &#9472;&#769;&#9472;&nbsp;&#9472;&#9472;&nbsp;&#9472;&#9472;), no doubt owing to the greater
stress at the opening of the verse.</p>

<p>Some exceptions (or apparent exceptions) to these rules
will no doubt be found. But the rules cover most of the
extant examples of saturnian verse: and it must be remembered
that the text of our fragments is often not at all
certain. The system outlined has, however, the merit&mdash;which
it shares with Lindsay&mdash;that it dispenses with most
of the alterations of the text in which other systems
involve us.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Hymn of the Arval Brotherhood</span>.</p>

<p>I have given the text of this celebrated piece according
to what may be called the Vulgate; and in the sub-title, in
the Glossary and in my Introduction p. 1 I have followed
the ordinary interpretation. I may perhaps be allowed
here to suggest a different view of the poem.</p>

<p>It begins with an appeal to the Lares. These are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>
apparently the Lares Consitivi, gods of sowing. Then
comes an appeal to Marmar, then to Mars. Then the
Semones are invoked, who, like the Lares, are gods of
sowing. There follows a final appeal to Marmar.</p>

<p>It is pretty clear that the Mars, Marmar, or Marmor,
invoked in such iteration is not the war-god, but Mars in
his more ancient character of a god of agriculture. But
if this be so, what are we to make of lines 7-9,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">satur fu, fere Mars: limen sali: sta berber,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'Be thou glutted, fierce Mars, leap the threshold, stay
thy scourge',&mdash;or, as Buecheler takes it, 'stand, wild god'?
This sort of language is appropriate enough to Mars as
god of war, but utterly inappropriate to the farmer's god<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.</p>

<p>Now it so happens that for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">satur fu, fere Mars: limen sali, sta berber<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the monumental stone to which we owe this inscription
offers at one point</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">satur fu, fere Mars limen saii sia berber.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now, when we remember the Lares Consitivi and the
Semones, does it not look very much as though <i>satur</i>
stood for <i>sator</i>, as though <i>fere</i> were a blunder for <i>sere</i>,
as though <i>saii</i> were the vocative of Saius, 'sower' (cf. Seia
a goddess of sowing, and Greek &#963;&#8049;&#969; &#963;&#8053;&#952;&#969;), as though <i>sia</i>
were the imperative of the verb <i>sio</i> (moisten)<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, and as
though, finally, <i>berber</i> were to be connected with the Greek
&#946;&#8057;&#961;&#946;&#959;&#961;&#965;&#962; and meant 'loam'? (I would give much the
same sense, 'fat soil' to <i>limen</i>: (from the root <i>lib-</i>: cf.
Gk. &#955;&#949;&#8055;&#946;&#969; &#955;&#949;&#953;&#956;&#8061;&#957;).)</p>

<p>We get, then,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">sator fu: sere Mars limen Saii, sia berber,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'Be thou the sower: sower Mars, sow the soil, moisten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a></span>
the loam'. And this suggests what <i>ought</i> to be the meaning
of <i>enos iuuate</i>. <i>enos</i> <i>ought</i> to mean <i>harvests</i>, or at
any rate something in that kind. And why should it not?
Hesychius knew a word &#7956;&#957;&#959;&#962; which he glosses by &#7952;&#957;&#953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8057;&#962;, &#7952;&#960;&#8051;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#961;&#960;&#8057;&#962;.
See Suidas <i>s.v.</i> and Herwerden <i>Lexicon
Suppletorium</i>.</p>

<p>The Hymn is a hymn for Seedtime. We know, however,
that the festival at which it was sung fell in the
month of May. The explanation of this has been hinted
at by Henzen.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Henzen points out that the Arval
Brothers entered on their duties at the Saturnalia, and
that their worship is probably connected in its origin with
Saturn, the god of sowing. (See Varro <i>L.L.</i> 5, 57, and
<i>apud</i> Aug. <i>C.D.</i> 7. 13 p. 290, 28, Festus <i>s.v.</i> Saturnus.)
We must suppose, therefore, that at some date when the
meaning of its words had been already lost this hymn was
transferred from a seedtime festival to a harvest festival.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
